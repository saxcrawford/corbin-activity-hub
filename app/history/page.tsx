                                The town now known as Corbin was officially incorporated in
                                1895, situated along Lynn Camp Creek. Before incorporation, the
                                area bore the name Lynn Camp, after William Lynn, a traveler
                                from Virginia who disappeared in the region around 1800.

                                Following the American Civil War, the landscape between London
                                and Williamsburg contained only about half a dozen farms. Just
                                north of present-day Corbin stood a mill run by the McHargue
                                family and a post office called &quot;Whip-poor-will.&quot;
                                Nearby communities included Woodbine, which had a post office in
                                Liberty Sutton&apos;s residence, and Rockholds, where Rosa
                                Graves managed a tavern. Another tavern was operated by H.C.
                                Gillis. The 1870s saw few inhabitants in the area, with notable
                                early settlers including the families of Nelson Cummins and John
                                Moore.

                                Interestingly, the wives of these two families—Emaline Cummins
                                and Armelda Moore—were sisters, daughters of George Y. Sears,
                                who owned substantial land in the region. Railroad development
                                played a crucial role in the town&apos;s growth. After the Civil
                                War, tracks initially extended only as far as Livingston,
                                Kentucky, but by 1883, they reached what would become Corbin and
                                continued to Jellico.

                                The town&apos;s naming has an interesting
                                history. James Eaton, serving as the first postmaster, initially
                                named the settlement &quot;Cummins&quot; to honor his friend
                                Nelson Cummins. However, the U.S. Postal Department informed him
                                this name couldn&apos;t be used because another post office with
                                the same name already existed in Rockcastle County. In 1885,
                                Eaton renamed the town after Reverend James Corbin Floyd, a
                                minister who happened to be visiting at that time.{" "}
